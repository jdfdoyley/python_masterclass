# PYTHON FOR LOOP
# The for statement in Python is a bit different from what you usually use in
# other programming languages.

# Rather than iterating over a number progression, Python's for statement
# iterates over the items of any iterable (list, tuple, dictionary, set, or
# string). The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the iterable.

# SYNTAX
# for var in iterable:
#     statement
#     statement
#     ...
# else:
#     statement
#     statement
#     ...

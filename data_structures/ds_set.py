"""This file demonstrate the use of Python Set."""

# PYTHON SET
# Python set is an unordered collection of unique items. They are commonly used
# for computing mathematical operations such as union, intersection,
# difference, and symmetric difference.

# The important properties of Python sets are as follows:

# Sets are unordered – Items stored in a set aren’t kept in any particular
# order.
# Set items are unique – Duplicate items are not allowed.
# Sets are unindexed – You cannot access set items by referring to an index.
# Sets are changeable (mutable) – They can be changed in place, can grow and
# shrink on demand.

This repo is based on the [Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/), taught by Tim Buchalka on Udemy, I currently take.

My goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the Python programming language so I can then use it to solve real world problems. In an effort to stay motivated and consistent, I decided to use the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge concept.

This challenge offers the ideal system for me accomplish my goal. I will document my progress here as well. This too will also help me getting comfortable using Git and GitHub. Now it's time to get cracking; here I go...

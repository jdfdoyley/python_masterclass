# Python Masterclass

This repo is based on the [Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/), taught by Tim
Buchalka on Udemy, in addition with [Learn by Example](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python/) website, resources I am
currently using.

My goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the Python programming language
so I can then use it to solve real world problems. In an effort to stay
motivated and consistent, I decided to use the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge concept.

This challenge offers the ideal system for me accomplish my goal. I will document my progress here as well. This too will also help me getting comfortable using Git and GitHub. Now it's time to get cracking; here I go...
